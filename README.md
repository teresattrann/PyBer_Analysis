# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city. By using Matplotlib, we are able to go through each city type and obtain/graph our data in order to find out the total weekly fares for each city type. We can then use that data to see how the fares in each city differ depending on the amount of drivers and rides they had. 

## Results
We can see in the data the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types: 
* In the Rural Cities, we can see that there was only a total of 125 rides and 78 drivers. The total fares was $4,327.93. The average fare per ride was $34.62, while the average fare per driver was $55.49.
* In the Suburban Cities, we can see that there was a total of 625 rides and 490 drivers. The total fares was $19,356.33. The average fare per ride was $30.97, while the average fare per driver was $39.50.
* In the Urban Cities, we can see that there was a total of 1,625 rides and 2,405 drivers. The total fares was $39,854.38. The average fare per ride was $24.53, while the average fare per driver was $16.57.

Given our data, we can see that the total fares in the Urban Cities was exponentital higher than the Rural Cities, but we can also see the increase in demand for rides in Urban Cities. With that, the average fare per ride and driver in the Urban Cities was a lot less expensive as there was about 1.5 times the amount of drivers vs. rides, the complete opposite of that in the Rural Cities, with 1.6 times the amount of rides vs. drives.

## Summary
Three business recommendations I can recommend to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types based on the data is to decrease the amount of drivers in the Urban Cities, as well as increase the amount of drivers in the Rural Cities. As stated in our results, we can see that the drivers vs. rides ratio in the Urban Cities is 1.5 to 1, respectively, which means that there is way too many drivers and not enough people taking rides. That also decreases the average fare per driver by even more than double compared to the Rural and Suburban Cities. Alternatively, in the Rural Cities, the ratio for drivers vs. rides is 1 to 1.6, meaning that there is not enough drivers to accommadate the demand of rides. Because of that, the average fare per ride is a lot higher in the Rural Cities compared to that of the Surbuban and Urban Cites. I think the Suburban Cities have a good balance between the amount of drivers vs. the amount of rides so I would recommend the Suburban Cities to stay the way they are as the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is fairly balanced.
